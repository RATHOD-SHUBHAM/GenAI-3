🌟 PCBinsightAI: Your New PCB Defect Detective 🌟



I’ve been working on something cool: PCBinsightAI! 🚀 Leveraging a powerhouse of advanced technologies, including YOLOv10 for object detection, SAM for segmentation, and OpenAI's Language Model (LLM) for intelligent chat capabilities, PCBinsightAI brings unparalleled precision to identifying and understanding defects in printed circuit boards.



🔍 Object Detection with YOLOv10: PCBinsightAI utilizes the state-of-the-art YOLOv10 model to accurately identify defects in uploaded PCB images. With its high precision and speed, YOLOv10 forms the backbone of the defect detection pipeline.



🖼️ Segmentation with SAM: Following object detection, SAM (Segmentation-Aware Modules) steps in to provide precise segmentation of detected defects. This ensures that each defect is precisely outlined, enabling comprehensive analysis and understanding.



💬 Intelligent Chat with OpenAI LLM: PCBinsightAI doesn't stop there! With the integration of OpenAI's Language Model, users can now engage in insightful conversations about detected defects. Whether it's understanding the root causes of damage or exploring precautionary measures, the LLM-powered chat feature is here to provide valuable insights and guidance.



🔢 Cutting-Edge Techniques: Behind the scenes, PCBinsightAI harnesses advanced techniques such as RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and VectorDB (Pinecone) for enhanced performance and efficiency. By employing innovative methods like embedding models and semantic search, PCBinsightAI ensures a fast and accurate responses.



🌐💡Here's how it works:

 * Upload: Simply upload an image of your PCB.

 * Object Detection: Powerful YOLOv10 model scans the image and identifies any defects.

 * Segmentation: The SAM model steps in to segment these defects with pinpoint accuracy.

 * Interactive Chat: With OpenAI’s LLM, you can ask questions about the defects, learn their causes, and get advice on prevention and remedies.
